Techno-Economic Analysis of Solid Alkaline Fuel Cells for Off-Grid Power Generation
This project explores the potential of Solid Alkaline Fuel Cells (SAFCs) as a sustainable and reliable power source for off-grid communities. Through a detailed techno-economic analysis, the study compares SAFCs with traditional photovoltaic systems, considering factors like efficiency, energy output, lifetime costs, and infrastructure requirements.

The work includes:

Fuel Cell Design & Working Principles: Understanding the chemistry and structure of SAFCs.
Python-Based Modeling: A program to compute key performance metrics (EMF, power output, efficiency, and heat dissipation) under varying conditions of temperature, electrolyte composition, and hydrogen pressure.
Data Visualization & Analysis: Tabulated data and plotted curves to visualize system performance across different scenarios.
Economic Evaluation: A cost breakdown of components, hydrogen infrastructure, and long-term operational expenses.
Comparative Study: A side-by-side comparison of SAFCs and photovoltaic systems, analyzing their suitability for off-grid applications in terms of reliability, environmental impact, and cost-effectiveness.
This project highlights the promise of SAFCs in revolutionizing decentralized energy generation, while addressing the technical and economic challenges that impact their wider adoption.
